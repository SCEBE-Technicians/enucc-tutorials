This site contains tutorials for mini-projects which are to be run on the Edinburgh Napier University Compute Cluster (ENUCC). These tutorials aim to be

- Small - the projects are toy-projects meant to illustrate a single concept.
- Self contained - the projects should be able to be run from start to finis, with no steps left implicit.
- Useful - by completing the tutorial you will develop skills which will be useful in a more complex piece of work.

### Problems
