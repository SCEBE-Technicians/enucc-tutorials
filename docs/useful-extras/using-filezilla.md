#Using Filezilla

Filezilla is a program which allows you to easily move files between your local machine and a remote server (ENUCC in this case). If you have a managed machine you can download FileZilla from [AppsAnywhere](https://apps.napier.ac.uk/). Otherwise you can download the FileZilla **client** from the [website](https://filezilla-project.org/).

When you open FileZilla you'll see the following screen.

At the top of the screen you'll see a few fields which you can fill in. For the Host you'll want to put `login.enucc.napier.ac.uk`. For username you'll need to put your university staff or student number, `4XXXXXXX`. For the password, you'll type in your usual password. Finally for the port you'll need to put `22`.
