# Next Steps

Hopefully this series has given you a good start with using MPI in your C or C++ projects. Message passing programming is a very deep rabbit hole and you could spend years exploring its possibilities if you wanted.

If you have decided you want to start using MPI seriously then the book recommendations on this site are probably a good place to go next.

Otherwise, like all programming paradigms, the most important thing is to use it as much as possible. As the proverb goes 'De réir a chéile a thógtar na caisleáin' - it takes time to build castles.
