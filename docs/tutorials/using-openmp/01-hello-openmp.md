# Hello OpenMP

## Description

OpenMP is an API for shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++ and Fortran. This series will cover the basics of using OpenMP to improve the performance of programs in C or C++. Since ENUCC compute nodes have 64 threads, it is possible to make good use of these by parallelising computationally intensive tasks. If you wanted to use more than 64 threads then you'll want to use the message passing interface API instead.

## Prerequisites

It is necessary to have a good understanding of the C programming language in order to start using OpenMP. If you want an overview of the language then "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie is one of the standard texts.
